                        <p>This year the Interschool Debate Competition was held at St.Xaviers School. There were 24 different schools participating. The competition was held for a week. Food and accommodation were arranged at school canteen. All the participants were extraordinarily skilled.One could actually see the future leaders in the contestants. The decisions of the judges were final. There were no foul plays. This year St.Xaviers School won the first prize and much to our amazement two of the best speakers were from St.Xaviers School.All the participants were students with equal calibre and potential but in the end, some stood out shining brighter than the others. The topic for the final competition was " the increasing number of old age homes in India ". There were so many notable points presented by each team but the point presented by the winning team was the game-changer.

Every parent believes their style is the best, and since the Gurgaon parent is extremely proactive on online forums on every debate, from which school better to how much sleep your child should get, living-room discussions and online threads these days are all about whether AC classrooms are the way to go or not. There are those who believe that airconditioned schools make children spoilt, arrogant and soft. But the counter-argument by others is that when ACs are a vital part of homes, and power cuts give people nightmares, why should children be subjected to the harsh weather? Two Gurgaon parents debate this.Kanupriya Jain, 37, a textile and graphic designer who lives in Park View City1, Sohna road, is sure that she doesn't want an AC school for her two-year-old. She lists out her reasons: I have studied in a non-airconditioned school and I feel that people of our time are more rough and tough. Even though we are in airconditioning most of the time nowadays, we don't feel shy away from standing under the sun when needed. But children today can't withstand the heat. It is majorly because of their habit of being under AC all the time. Also, I have observed that immunity levels are higher in people who spend less time in AC environments..</p>

CCTV cameras in classrooms and on the corridors keep an eye on teachers as well as students. Not only the behavior but it also shows you whether a teacher is teaching efficiently in class or not. A teacher too has to follow many rules and regulations while teaching in a class and he also has to be watched upon. Having cameras in a classroom are beneficial for students, teachers, parents, and schools because they hold teachers accountable, help students improve their behavior, and evaluate teacher and student interactions. This would prevent abuse both from teachers and from students. It protects both teachers and students.</p>
